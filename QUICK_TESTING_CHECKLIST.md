- [ ] Data created in one portal appears in others

## ‚ùå **Common Issues & Quick Fixes**

### "Access Denied" or "No Portal Access"
**Fix**: Check your `portal_access` records in Supabase
```sql
SELECT * FROM portal_access WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';
```

### "No Data Showing"
**Fix**: Verify your test data was created
```sql
SELECT * FROM active_quotes_view;
SELECT * FROM pending_applications_view;
```

### "Calculator Won't Load"
**Fix**: Check if your calculator URL is accessible
- Try opening `https://mxdealeradvantage.com.au` directly

### "Authentication Issues"
**Fix**: Check Google OAuth setup in Supabase
- Go to Supabase ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Settings
- Verify Google OAuth is enabled

## üéØ **What This Tests**

‚úÖ **Authentication**: Google OAuth across all portals
‚úÖ **Database Integration**: Real Supabase data loading
‚úÖ **Cross-Platform Data**: Data visibility across portals
‚úÖ **Calculator Integration**: Your existing calculator in dealer portal
‚úÖ **User Permissions**: Role-based access control
‚úÖ **Real-Time Updates**: Data synchronization

## üìû **If You Need Help**

3. **Verify your .env.local** has correct Supabase credentials
4. **Test each portal individually** to isolate issues

## üöÄ **Next Steps After Testing**

Once basic testing works:
- [ ] Create real dealer accounts using admin interface
- [ ] Test with actual vehicle data from your calculator
- [ ] Invite real dealers to test the platform
- [ ] Monitor performance and gather feedback

This quick test will verify your entire multi-portal system is working with live Supabase data!
