## üõ† **Troubleshooting Commands**

### Check Your User ID
```sql
-- Find your user ID after signing in
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your-email@gmail.com';
```

### Check Portal Access
```sql
-- Verify your portal access records
SELECT * FROM portal_access WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';
```

### Check Data Flow
```sql
-- See all your quotes
SELECT * FROM lease_quotes WHERE employee_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM employees WHERE email = 'your-email@gmail.com'
);

-- See all your applications
SELECT * FROM lease_applications WHERE employee_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM employees WHERE email = 'your-email@gmail.com'
);
```
